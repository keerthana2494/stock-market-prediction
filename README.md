In the past decades, there is an increasing interest in predicting markets among
economists, policymakers, academics and market makers. The objective of the
proposed work is to study and improve the supervised learning algorithms to
predict the stock price. Stock Market Analysis of stocks using data mining will be
useful for new investors to invest in stock market based on the various factors
considered by the software. Stock market includes daily activities like Sensex
calculation, exchange of shares. The exchange provides an efficient and
transparent market for trading in equity, debt instruments and derivatives. Our
aim is to create software that analyses previous stock data of certain companies,
with help of certain parameters that affect stock value. We are going to
implement these values in data mining algorithms and we will be able to decide
which algorithm gives the best result. This will also help us to determine the
values that particular stock will have in near future. We will determine the
patterns in data with help of machine learning algorithms.
